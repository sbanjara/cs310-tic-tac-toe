#  TIC-TAC-TOE

## Description
   This project is an implementation of tic-tac-toe game. It was one of the projects of my Software Engineering I class. 
   It has two branches,
   
   1. master 
   2. GUIImplementation 
   
   The master implements the game in a console. The user can choose the size of a board by providing the arguments in the command prompt      (for instance, cs310-tic-tac-toe.jar 4 4). The default board size for the game is 3x3 unless specified by the user. The game continues    until **Player 1 (X)** or **Player 2 (O)** wins or there is **Tie**.
   
   The GUIImplementation implements the game in the GUI form. It will display the board with 3x3 dimensions unless specified by the user
   when initializing the controller class. The user will make a move (make a mark) via a button click - the first move is always a **X**      move.
